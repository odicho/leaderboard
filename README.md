# XM AROUND THE WORLD

I built this project for my team @ Qualtrics. The web app enables us to collaborate on a mission, using a beautiful user interface.

[xmaround.world](https://www.xmaround.world/) collects the mileage of everyone in the team and aggregates it to a total number on the home page. You can also click on each individual profile to see a week-by-week view. This project is named "leaderboard" because it was initially an actual leaderboard, but got modified to remove the competetive aspect of tracking the mileage.

The calendar picker is custom built and inspired by [cal.com's](http://cal.com/) design.
